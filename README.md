# Pixie

Pixie is a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot designed to assist with playing D&D 5e. Mostly it helps with referring to source books (by telling you which book and page a piece of information is on), but it can also roll dice, generate basic random characters, and more.

### Having Pixie Connect to Your Server

Pixie needs to be added to a server by someone with admin permissions. If you would like to add the pixie app, simply [click this link](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=484413321597026325&permissions=448576&scope=bot) to get started.

Currently Pixie is still in alpha/early development and is not online very much. Please come back soon for updates!

### Functionality

Pixie is designed to be used from the chat window of a Discord server. All commands are entered by typing `!pixie <command> <input>`. For a list of available commands, try `!pixie help`.
